*RULES*
 1. Keep importance below 150 else words will appear annoying often
 2. NO WHITESPACES. PERIOD.
 3. use appropriate flags if possible *see below*
     { abbreviation, babytalk, drugs, e, medical, n, offensive, p, r, s, technical }
 3. The format  <w f="100" flags="">ImAWord</w>
 4. Each entry has a frequency between 255 and 0.
     Highest frequency words get more weight in the prediction algorithm. As a
     special case, a weight of 0 is taken to mean profanity - words that should
     not be considered a typo, but that should never be suggested explicitly.
     You can capitalize words that must always be capitalized, such as "January".
     You can have a capitalized and a non-capitalized word as separate entries,
     such as "robin" and "Robin".

Possible flag usages:
e = ethnic slur
n = nouns
p = pop-culture reference
r = rude?
s = sedatives?

*NOTE*
Please note the KangDict may contains words recognized
    by our community but not the greater world... yet!
